<h2>üî• HEADLINE STORY: China's Strategic Power Play Reshapes Global Order</h2>
<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Xi Jinping unveiled a Global Governance Initiative while presiding over a vast military parade attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, showcasing hypersonic missiles and laser-defence systems.</p>
<p><strong>The Background</strong>: Ostensibly marking 80 years since WWII's end, the event served to challenge the US-led order. China displayed inter-continental missiles, autonomous underwater drones and other next-gen platforms, framing itself as champion of a "more democratic" world system.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong>: The initiative‚Äîbuilt on sovereign equality, rule-based multilateralism and development rights‚Äîsignals Beijing's most explicit bid to reshape global institutions, courting the Global South while eroding Western dominance.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Connect</strong>: Ties to <em>multipolarity</em>, <em>hegemonic transition theory</em> and <em>hard-soft power fusion</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Think Deeper</strong>: How do rising powers historically alter the balance of institutions? What options remain for mid-sized states navigating competing systems?</p>
<p><strong>Global Perspective</strong>: Critics note the paradox of extolling peace alongside allies active in current conflicts, underscoring tensions between rhetoric and reality.</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts</strong>: <em>Deterrence</em>, <em>strategic autonomy</em>, <em>alliance politics</em>, <em>global governance</em>, <em>norm entrepreneurship</em>.</p>

<h2>‚ö° MAJOR UPDATES</h2>
<h3>India's GST Cuts Aim to Jump-Start Consumption</h3>

<p><strong>Learning Bridge</strong>: Demonstrates <em>fiscal stimulus</em> vs <em>monetary easing</em>, highlighting indirect-tax tools' reach across income classes.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Angles</strong>: Economists debate whether short-term demand pushes outweigh risks of revenue loss and imported inflation.</p>
<h3>Thailand Elects Third Prime Minister in Two Years</h3>
<p><strong>The Development</strong>: Parliament chose Anutin Charnvirakul after Paetongtarn Shinawatra was disqualified over Cambodia-border ethics charges.</p>
<p><strong>The Significance</strong>: Continues a pattern of judicial-political tussles since 2006, fuelling investor anxiety as tourism-led recovery stutters.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Bridge</strong>: Case study in <em>constitutional checks and balances</em>, <em>judicial activism</em> and <em>civil-military relations</em> in emerging democracies.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Angles</strong>: Will coalition fragility prompt reforms, or repeat the coup-cycle Thailand has experienced roughly every seven years?</p>

<em>Looking ahead</em>: US-China tariff escalation may shift supply chains toward India; ASEAN political flux could test regional security frameworks.</p>
