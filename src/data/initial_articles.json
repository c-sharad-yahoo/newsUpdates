China displayed inter-continental missiles, autonomous underwater drones and other next-gen platforms, framing itself as champion of a \"more democratic\" world system.</p>\n<p><strong>Why This Matters</strong>: The initiativeâ€”built on sovereign equality, rule-based multilateralism and development rightsâ€”signals Beijing's most explicit bid to reshape global institutions, courting the Global South while eroding Western dominance.</p>\n<p><strong>Knowledge Connect</strong>: Ties to <em>multipolarity</em>, <em>hegemonic transition theory</em> and <em>hard-soft power fusion</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Think Deeper</strong>: How do rising powers historically alter the balance of institutions?
